    "# Project v16 Improvements based on v15:\n",
    "- Train activities with Passengers:\n",
    "    - Trains are sorted and processed by the expected arrival of their Passengers instead of their speed\n",
    "    (Trains without Passengers are still processed ordered by their speed)\n",
    "- When searching for an empty Train for an exchange at a Station:\n",
    "    - If a Train was found and he already has an active route, the route is adapted to execute the exchange\n",
    "    and continue on its old route after that\n",
    "\n",

    "## ----------------!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!----------------\n",
    "To execute the program, please make sure that an input file is correctly referenced in the function read_input_from_file\n",
    "## ----------------!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further possible improvements:\n",
    "- Trains can drive through a Station if no passenger wants to leave or board\n",
    "- For passengers that are not first priority of the fastest Train at its current Station, check if taking other trains might be faster\n",
    "- Prioritizing passengers should also take the length to their destination into account\n",
    "- Trains without passengers should check if they are of use at another station or if they just block the line, before they depart without passengers\n",
    "- Complete different approach (Machine Learning algorithms, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "0. Preparation\n",
    "    - Sort passengers by expected arrival\n",
    "    - Sort trains by their speed\n",
    "    - Determine the shortest route for each passenger from current location\n",
    "    - Set starting station for every train that has none\n",
    "1. Increment round\n",
    "2. Execute actions (capacities can be temporarily exceeded)\n",
    "3. Check capacities at the end of each round\n",
    "4. Check end conditions at the end of each round\n",
    "5. Back to 1. (if not ended)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions:\n",
    "- Stations\n",
    "- Lines\n",
    "- Passengers\n",
    "    1. Board\n",
    "    2. Detrain\n",
    "- Train\n",
    "    1. Depart (after checking capacity)\n",
    "    2. Arrive (if speed x round > line length)\n",
    "\n",
    "### End Conditions:\n",
    "- All passengers arrived at their destination\n",
    "- At the end of the round all capacities are kept"
